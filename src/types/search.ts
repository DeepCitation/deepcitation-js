/**
 * Indicates which variation of the citation was matched.
 * Trust decreases as we fall back from fullPhrase to anchorText to partial matches.
 *
 * HIGH TRUST (green indicator):
 * - exact_full_phrase: Exact match on the full phrase
 * - normalized_full_phrase: Full phrase matched with whitespace/case normalization
 *
 * MEDIUM TRUST (green indicator, shows context in popover):
 * - exact_anchor_text: anchorText matched exactly, but fullPhrase was not found
 * - normalized_anchor_text: anchorText matched with normalization
 *
 * LOW TRUST (amber indicator):
 * - partial_full_phrase: Only part of fullPhrase matched (tables, columns, line breaks)
 * - partial_anchor_text: Only part of anchorText matched
 * - first_word_only: Only first word matched (lowest trust)
