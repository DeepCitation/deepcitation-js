## Pending Upgrades (⚠️)

These require full testing before upgrading. Recommended order: Phase 2, then Phase 3.

### Phase 2: Jest Major Version (1-2 hours testing)

#### 4. jest: 29.7.0 → 30.2.0
- **Type**: Major version bump
- **Key changes**:
  - Deprecated matcher aliases removed (e.g., `toBeCalled()` → `toHaveBeenCalled()`)
  - jest.mock() now case-sensitive
  - jest.genMockFromModule() removed
  - Node >=18 required ✅ (you have this)
  - TypeScript >=5.4 required ✅ (you have 5.9.3)
- **Impact on codebase**: Low (no deprecated matchers detected)
- **Action needed**: Run full test suite
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade together with jest-environment-jsdom and @jest/globals

#### 5. jest-environment-jsdom: 29.7.0 → 30.2.0
- **Type**: Major version bump
- **Key changes**: Upgrades jsdom from v21 to v26 (DOM behavior may change subtly)
- **Impact on codebase**: Low (primary test env is happy-dom)
- **Action needed**: Run component tests (`npm run test:ct`)
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade with Jest 30

#### 6. @jest/globals: 29.7.0 → 30.2.0
- **Type**: Major version bump (type changes only)
- **Key changes**: Removed types `SpyInstance`, `MockFunctionMetadata`
- **Impact on codebase**: None (not using these types)
- **Action needed**: Search codebase for usage
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade with Jest 30

### Phase 3: Size-limit Tools (30 minutes testing)

#### 7. size-limit: 11.2.0 → 12.0.0
- **Type**: Major version bump
- **Key changes**:
  - Node.js 18 dropped (requires >=19)
  - chokidar removed (replaced with native fs.watch)
  - jiti moved to optional dependency
- **Impact on codebase**: None (CLI only)
- **Action needed**: Run size check (`npm run size`)
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade after Phase 2

#### 8. @size-limit/preset-small-lib: 11.2.0 → 12.0.0
- **Type**: Major version bump
- **Key changes**: Same as size-limit
- **Impact on codebase**: None (config changes not needed)
- **Action needed**: Run with size-limit
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade together with size-limit

---

## Skipped Upgrades (❌)

### 9. rimraf: 5.0.10 → 6.1.2
- **Reason**: Incompatible with Node.js policy
- **Issue**: Requires Node.js >=20
- **Your policy**: Supports Node.js >=18
- **Impact**: Would break compatibility with Node 18 and 19
- **Recommendation**: **Skip this upgrade** unless Node.js minimum version is updated to >=20
- **Status**: Not upgraded

---

## Next Steps

### To Proceed with Phase 2 (Jest Major Upgrade):

```bash
# Install Jest 30 and related tools
bun add --save-dev \
  "jest@30.2.0" \
  "@jest/globals@30.2.0" \
  "jest-environment-jsdom@30.2.0"

# Run full test suite
npm run build
npm run test:jest
npm run test:ct
npm run lint

# If all pass, proceed to Phase 3
```

### To Proceed with Phase 3 (size-limit Tools):

```bash
# Install size-limit 12
bun add --save-dev \
  "size-limit@12.0.0" \
  "@size-limit/preset-small-lib@12.0.0"

# Verify size limits still pass
npm run build
npm run size

# If all pass, you're done
```

### To Keep rimraf at Current Version:

No action needed. rimraf 5.0.10 is stable and works fine. The upgrade to 6.x is optional and only necessary if you upgrade Node.js minimum to >=20.

## Decision Rationale

**Why Phase 1 now?**
- These are type-only updates with zero breaking changes
- Provides immediate TypeScript improvements
- Zero risk to functionality
- Improves type safety

**Why Phase 2 later?**
- Jest 30 is a major version with breaking changes
- Requires comprehensive test execution
- No code changes expected, but verification critical
- Should be done in dedicated PR with test results

**Why Phase 3 after Phase 2?**
- size-limit tools depend on having tests passing
- Lower priority than Jest (tooling vs testing)
- Can be done immediately after Phase 2 verification

**Why skip rimraf?**
- Breaking incompatibility with Node.js >=18 support
- Your package.json specifies "engines": { "node": ">=18" }
- Upgrading would violate this constraint
- Can be revisited if Node.js policy changes to >=20
