# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `onSourceDownload` callback prop on `CitationComponent` — renders a download button in the popover header for both URL and Document citations.
- `DownloadIcon` SVG component exported from `deepcitation/react`.
- `footnote` display variant — a clean numeric footnote marker with neutral gray default and status-aware coloring after verification.

### Deprecated

- `prepareAttachment()` is deprecated in favor of `prepareAttachments()`. The old method remains as a compatibility alias and will be removed in the next major release.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-25

First public release of `deepcitation` — deterministic citation verification for AI-generated content. Every claim your LLM makes gets checked against the source document, with visual proof your users can see and trust.

### Highlights

- **Verify, don't detect** — Unlike hallucination detectors that estimate confidence, DeepCitation matches each citation against uploaded source documents and returns a deterministic `found` / `not_found` result. No probabilities, no guessing.
- **Visual proof with progressive disclosure** — Citations start as subtle inline indicators (an underline, a superscript, a chip). Click to see the verification status. Click deeper to see the exact passage on the source page, highlighted and cropped. Users who just want to read can ignore them; users who want to verify can drill all the way down to the source image.
- **Page view with keyhole evidence** — Verified citations show a cropped "keyhole" view of the matching region on the source page, then expand to a full-page view with zoom controls. The goal: build trust without requiring users to leave the conversation and open a PDF.
- **6 display variants** — `linter` (spell-check underlines), `chip` (pill badges), `brackets`, `text`, `superscript` (footnotes), and `badge` (ChatGPT-style source chips). Each tuned for different contexts — long-form research, chat UIs, academic papers, minimal dashboards.
- **Low cognitive load by default** — Verified citations are quiet (subtle green indicator). Only unverified claims demand attention (red wavy underline). The visual hierarchy prioritizes reading flow over verification noise.
- **Works with any LLM** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, local models. Citation extraction, prompt wrapping, and all rendering work entirely client-side with zero dependencies.
- **Multi-format rendering** — Slack, GitHub, HTML, terminal, and markdown renderers for non-React environments. Same verification data, rendered for each platform.

### What's included

- Citation extraction and parsing from LLM output
- Prompt wrapping utilities (`wrapCitationPrompt`, `wrapSystemCitationPrompt`)
- DeepCitation API client for file upload and verification
- React components: `CitationComponent`, `UrlCitationComponent`, `CitationDrawer`, `SourcesListComponent`
- Composable primitives: `Citation.Root`, `Citation.Trigger`, `Citation.AnchorText`, `Citation.Indicator`
- Platform renderers: Slack, GitHub, HTML, terminal, markdown
- Structured error classes: `AuthenticationError`, `RateLimitError`, `NetworkError`, `ValidationError`, `ServerError`
- Pluggable logger interface for observability (Datadog, Sentry, OpenTelemetry, etc.)
- Dark mode support, mobile-responsive popovers, keyboard navigation
- TypeScript-first with full type exports
- Zero runtime dependencies (React components require React + `@radix-ui/react-popover`)

### Migration from `@deepcitation/deepcitation-js`

```diff
- npm install @deepcitation/deepcitation-js
+ npm install deepcitation
```

```diff
- import { DeepCitation } from "@deepcitation/deepcitation-js";
+ import { DeepCitation } from "deepcitation";

- import { CitationComponent } from "@deepcitation/deepcitation-js/react";
+ import { CitationComponent } from "deepcitation/react";
```

The API is identical — only the package name changed. The old package has been deprecated on npm.
