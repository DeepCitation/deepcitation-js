## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.51] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Linter variant** for CitationComponent - displays citations as inline text with semantic underlines (solid for verified, dashed for partial, wavy for not found, dotted for pending) (#107)
- **Badge variant** for UrlCitationComponent with improved status indicators (verified, partial, pending, blocked, error states) (#108)
- **Verification log timeline** in citation tooltip - shows the verification process with timestamps (#104)
- **Detailed search attempt info** in tooltip for failed lookups - helps debug why citations weren't found (#103)
- **Deferred JSON citation format** - optimized format for streaming responses with grouped search attempts UI (#94)
- **Visual showcase tests** for CitationComponent popover/tooltip states with dark mode support (#110)
- **`showIndicator` prop** for CitationComponent - control visibility of status indicators (checkmark, warning, spinner) (#111)
- **Expandable search details** for verified matches - see how matches were found even for successful verifications (#111)

### Changed
- **Citation popover redesign** - shadcn HoverCard aesthetic with cleaner UI (#113):
  - Neutral header backgrounds with colored status icons only
  - GitHub CI/CD-style verification timeline with numbered steps
  - Humanizing messages for failures (e.g., "We couldn't find..." instead of technical errors)
  - User-friendly method names ("Exact location", "Nearby lines" instead of "Exact Line Match")
  - Arrow format for page badges (`Pg 5 → 7`) instead of strikethrough
  - Improved dark mode contrast throughout
- Improved CitationTooltip UX with clearer status values and better visual feedback (#101)
- Renamed `keySpan` to `anchorText` and `startPageKey` to `startPageId` for clarity (#89)
- Optimized citation format: group citations by attachment with shorthand keys (#92)
- **Dark mode improvements** - superscript variant now inherits text color, popover headers use neutral backgrounds with colored icons only (#111)
- **URL citation variants** - chip/inline/bracket variants now use neutral gray colors instead of blue, better spacing with `mr-0.5` (#111)
- **Unexpected location display** - shows arrow format for page mismatch (e.g., `Pg 5 → 7`) (#111)

### Removed
- All deprecated APIs and backwards compatibility shims have been removed (#105):
  - `verifyAll()` - use `verify()` instead
  - `removeCitations()` - use `replaceCitations()` instead
  - Various deprecated type aliases and re-exports

## [1.1.50] - 2025-01-21

This release marks the first comprehensive public release of DeepCitation, consolidating all features developed since the initial v1.0.0 release.

### Core Features

#### Citation Verification System
- **DeepCitation API Client** - Upload documents and verify AI-generated citations against source materials
- **Visual Proof Generation** - Get verification images showing exactly where citations match in source documents
- **Multi-Format Support** - PDF (text & scanned), DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, HTML, images (JPG, PNG, TIFF, WebP, HEIC), and public URLs

#### LLM Prompt Utilities
- **`wrapSystemCitationPrompt()`** - Enhance system prompts with citation instructions
- **`wrapCitationPrompt()`** - Wrap both system and user prompts with citation guidance
- **`CITATION_JSON_OUTPUT_FORMAT`** - JSON schema for structured output LLMs (OpenAI, etc.)
- **`CITATION_REMINDER`** - Short reminder for reinforcement in user prompts
- **Position options**: `append`, `prepend`, `wrap` for optimal instruction placement

#### Citation Parsing
- **`getAllCitationsFromLlmOutput()`** - Extract citations from LLM response text
- **`parseCitation()`** - Parse individual citation tags
- **`normalizeCitation()`** - Normalize citation formats
- **`replaceCitations()`** - Replace or remove citations from text with verification status support
  - `leaveAnchorTextBehind` option to keep descriptive text
  - `showVerificationStatus` option for TUI status indicators (✓, ⚠, ✗, ◌)

### React Components

#### CitationComponent
- **5 Visual Variants**: `brackets` (default), `chip`, `text`, `superscript`, `minimal`
- **3 Content Modes**: `anchorText`, `number`, `indicator`
- **Status Indicators**: Pending (spinner), Verified (green ✓), Partial (amber ✓), Not Found (red △)
- **Interactive Popover**: Hover shows verification image, click expands to full-size
- **Customizable Behavior**: `behaviorConfig` prop for custom click/hover handlers

#### URL Citations
- **Unified Citation Model** - Support for both document and URL-based citations
- **URL Citation Fields** - `url`, `domain`, `title`, `description`, `faviconUrl`, `sourceType`, `platform`, `author`, `publishedAt`

#### SourcesListComponent
- **Aggregated Sources Display** - Show all sources in a panel/drawer (like Gemini's "Sources")
- **4 Variants**: `drawer` (mobile-friendly), `modal`, `panel`, `inline`
- **SourcesTrigger** - Button with stacked favicons to open sources list

#### Icons
- `DeepCitationIcon`, `CheckIcon`, `SpinnerIcon`, `WarningIcon` exported from `/react`

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS v4 Support** - Standalone `styles.css` for non-Tailwind users
- **Tailwind Presets** - Easy integration with existing Tailwind projects
- **shadcn/Radix Popover** - Modern, accessible popover implementation

### Package Structure
- **Granular Exports** - Import only what you need:
  - `@deepcitation/deepcitation-js` - Main entry (parsing, prompts)
  - `@deepcitation/deepcitation-js/client` - API client only
  - `@deepcitation/deepcitation-js/prompts` - Prompt utilities only
  - `@deepcitation/deepcitation-js/react` - React components
  - `@deepcitation/deepcitation-js/types` - TypeScript types only
- **Tree-Shakeable** - ESM and CJS builds with proper exports

### Performance & Reliability
- **Optimized Diff Algorithm** - Custom implementation replacing `diff` npm dependency for Firebase Functions compatibility
- **Robust Citation Parsing** - Handles escaped quotes, HTML entities, Markdown-escaped underscores, unclosed tags
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - 500+ tests covering parsing, normalization, and component behavior

### Examples
- **basic-verification** - Core 3-step workflow with OpenAI/Gemini
- **nextjs-ai-sdk** - Full-stack Next.js chat application
- **Raw API/curl** - Direct API usage without SDK

### Breaking Changes (from earlier 1.x versions)
- Removed `citation.css` - components now use Tailwind CSS exclusively
- Renamed `verifyCitations()` to `verify()` for cleaner API
- Removed `verifyCitationsFromLlmOutput()` (briefly renamed to `verifyAll()`, now removed)
- Renamed `fileId` to `attachmentId` throughout
- Renamed `PdfSpaceItem` to `SnippetPdfItem`
- `CitationVariant` type: removed `"indicator"` variant (use `content="indicator"` instead)
