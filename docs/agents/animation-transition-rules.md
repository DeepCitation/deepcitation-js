## Timing Scale

Five tiers cover all UI interactions. Match the tier to the perceptual weight of the motion:

| Constant | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ANIM_INSTANT_MS` | 75ms | Hover background, trigger color change |
| `ANIM_FAST_MS` | 120ms | Micro-interactions, exits, chevron rotations |
| `ANIM_STANDARD_MS` | 180ms | Popover entry fade, grid row expand |
| `ANIM_MEASURED_MS` | 250ms | Drawer slide-in, content morph |
| `ANIM_SLOW_MS` | 350ms | Full-page transitions |

The popover height morph uses asymmetric durations separate from this scale:

- Expand: `POPOVER_MORPH_EXPAND_MS` = 200ms
- Collapse: `POPOVER_MORPH_COLLAPSE_MS` = 100ms

Collapse is always faster than expand — collapsing content should feel snappy and responsive, not linger.

---

## Easing Curves

Two named curves are used throughout. Do not inline `cubic-bezier()` values directly — reference these constants.

| Constant | Value | Intent |
|---|---|---|
| `EASE_EXPAND` | `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.06, 0.64, 1)` | Spring-like ~6% overshoot — expanding content feels alive |
| `EASE_COLLAPSE` | `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` | Decisive deceleration — collapsing content exits cleanly |

Use `EASE_EXPAND` for things growing into view. Use `EASE_COLLAPSE` for things leaving.

Content that appears *after* a container expands uses `CONTENT_STAGGER_DELAY_MS` = 30ms so the container leads and content follows.

---

## Blink Standard Pattern

Use this as the default for popover/card show-hide and expanded-page step transitions:

- Enter: `BLINK_ENTER_TOTAL_MS` = 120ms
- Exit: `BLINK_EXIT_TOTAL_MS` = 80ms
- Motion type: opacity + very subtle scale settle (no directional travel)

Phase shape (reference sequence):

1. Initial: hidden.
2. Enter A (instant): mostly-final size, low opacity.
3. Enter B: subtle settle toward final scale, near-full opacity.
4. Steady: full size, full opacity.
5. Exit: opacity drops quickly with tiny scale change.
6. Unmount.

Implementation rules:

- Do not use top-to-bottom reveals (`gridTemplateRows`, padding grow) for this pattern.
- Do not use directional translation as the dominant motion cue.
- Keep motion subtle; readability should stay stable throughout.
- Keep durations asymmetric (expand slower than collapse).
- Use constants from `src/react/constants.ts`; never inline timing/easing.

---

## Evidence List Pattern

For `EvidenceTray` search-attempt list expansion/collapse (toggle + caret):

- Expand: `EVIDENCE_LIST_EXPAND_TOTAL_MS` = 120ms
- Expand settle step: `EVIDENCE_LIST_EXPAND_STEP_MS` = 60ms
- Collapse: `EVIDENCE_LIST_COLLAPSE_TOTAL_MS` = 80ms

The evidence list uses an inlined motion state machine in `EvidenceTray.tsx` (not `useBlinkMotionStage`) because it needs proportional height reveal from measured `scrollHeight` and per-stage multi-property CSS transitions.

### Expand frame sequence (120ms)

| Stage | Reveal | Opacity | Transition | Visual |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `idle` | 0% | 0 | — | List hidden, caret at 0° |
| `enter-a` (instant, 1 frame) | 20% | 0.72 | none | ~2/11 items, medium/high opacity, 4px pad + 1px shift |
| → `enter-b` (CSS 60ms) | 95% | 0.88 | 60ms BLINK_ENTER | ~10/11 items, light opacity (nearly visible) |
| → `steady` (CSS 60ms settle) | 100% | 1.0 | 60ms BLINK_ENTER | All items, full opacity, bottom pixels settle |

### Collapse frame sequence (80ms)

| Stage | Reveal | Opacity | Transition | Visual |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exit-a` (instant, 1 frame) | 70% | 0.65 | none | ~7/11 items, moderate fade, caret starts rotating |
| → `exit-b` (CSS 80ms) | 0% | 0.06 | 80ms BLINK_EXIT | Items shrink to hidden, barely visible |
| → `idle` (setTimeout) | 0% | 0 | — | Unmounted, caret at 0° |

The two-phase exit (`exit-a` → `exit-b`) forces the browser to paint the initial collapse state before starting the CSS transition. Without this, the browser may batch both style changes and skip the transition entirely.

### Rules

- Caret rotation uses the same 120/80 envelope and easing curves in the footer toggle.
- Large lists must remain reachable via inner scroll (`max-height + overflow-y:auto`), not by clipping.
- Opacity must increase during expand (0.72 → 0.88 → 1.0) — items become more visible as they reveal, never less.

## Popover View State Machine

The popover has three states: `"summary"` → `"expanded-keyhole"` → `"expanded-page"`.

Rules:
- Side is picked once on open (`useLockedPopoverSide`) and never changes for the lifetime of the popover. Do not re-evaluate or flip.
- `avoidCollisions` is unconditionally `false` on `<PopoverContent>`. Radix's flip/shift middleware is fully disabled. The hooks handle positioning.
- `expanded-page` records which state preceded it (`prevBeforeExpandedPageRef`) so Escape navigates back correctly.
- Width snaps to target — no `transition: width`. Intermediate frames during width changes are incoherent for content-heavy containers (text rewraps, images rescale).

Positioning is three-layer:

1. Radix `transform: translate3d()` — primary placement
2. `sideOffset` + `alignOffset` from hooks — optimize common cases
3. `useViewportBoundaryGuard` CSS `translate` — hard safety net, no-op when layers 1–2 are correct

Popover view-state transitions are snap-based at container level:
- Width/height still snap at layout level (no `transition: width`)
- Positioning stability is handled by the three positioning layers above
- Per-content motion should happen inside evidence/content zones, not by morphing the outer popover container

For full positioning documentation see `CLAUDE.md` → "Popover `avoidCollisions` Must Always Be `false`".

## Height Morph (`AnimatedHeightWrapper`)

`AnimatedHeightWrapper` in `DefaultPopoverContent.tsx` smoothly animates the claim-quote zone height when view state changes cause text to rewrap.

Rules:
- The wrapper `<div>` must always stay in the DOM. Do **not** conditionally render it or swap it for a Fragment.
- When `prefersReducedMotion` is true, pass `0` for both duration params to `useAnimatedHeight`. The hook bails out and clears inline styles immediately. Do not return `<>{children}</>` — the wrapper div must remain.
- A 0ms CSS transition does not fire `transitionend` (per CSS Transitions spec §3.1). `useAnimatedHeight` handles this by skipping the transition entirely and clearing styles inline when duration is 0.
- `onTransitionEnd` on the wrapper clears `height`, `overflow`, and `transition` inline styles after the animation completes. This is required to restore natural height after the pin.

## Always-Render Invariant (React 19)

All three evidence view states (summary `EvidenceTray`, expanded-keyhole `InlineExpandedImage`, expanded-page `InlineExpandedImage`) must be rendered simultaneously. Inactive views are hidden with `display: none`.

**Never conditionally mount or unmount a component inside the evidence zone.** React 19's StrictMode corrupts the fiber effect linked-list when components with hooks are conditionally swapped inside a Radix portal. This manifests as: `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'destroy')"` in `commitHookEffectListUnmount`.

This applies to the `EvidenceZone` component in `DefaultPopoverContent.tsx`. If you need to add a fourth view state, add a fourth always-rendered slot — do not use conditional rendering.

---

## Gesture System

### Drag-to-Pan (`useDragToPan`)
- Momentum physics: deceleration 0.88× per frame, velocity boost 2.0×, 5-sample history.
- Click is suppressed when drag distance exceeds 5px (`TAP_SLOP_PX` = 10px for touch).
- Supports x-only or xy direction via `direction` option.
- Fade-mask gradients (`buildKeyholeMaskImage`) show pan affordance at edges when content overflows by ≥ `MIN_PAN_OVERFLOW_PX` (24px).

### Wheel/Trackpad Zoom (`useWheelZoom`)
- GPU `transform: scale()` during gesture — zero layout reflow.
- Commits zoom to React state after 150ms debounce (prevents thrashing).
- Both keyhole and expanded-page use scroll-to-zoom (no `Ctrl` key required). `requireCtrl` defaults to `false`.
- Sensitivities: `KEYHOLE_WHEEL_ZOOM_SENSITIVITY` = 0.008, `WHEEL_ZOOM_SENSITIVITY` = 0.005.
- Zoom limits: keyhole 1.0–2.5, expanded 0.5–3.0. Clamp before setting state.

### Drawer Drag-to-Close (`useDrawerDragToClose`)
- Touch-only (touchstart on handle, touchmove/touchend on document).
- Rubber-band factor 0.4× past threshold — drag feels resistive, not free.
- Velocity ring buffer (4 samples), flick threshold 0.5px/ms.
- Snap-back via CSS transition when released within `DRAWER_DRAG_CLOSE_THRESHOLD_PX` (80px).
- Fires `triggerHaptic("collapse")` at threshold crossing.

### Pinch-to-Zoom (InlineExpandedImage)
- Handled inline in `EvidenceTray.tsx` via pointer events on `imageWrapperRef`.
- `applyGestureZoomTransform()` applies GPU `transform: translate + scale()` during gesture.
- On gesture end, committed zoom is clamped and set to React state.

### Keyboard Panning
- `InlineExpandedImage` supports arrow-key panning: 50px/keypress, Shift+200px.
- All four directions: ArrowLeft/Right → `scrollLeft`, ArrowUp/Down → `scrollTop`.
- Only `Enter` and `Space` collapse the expanded view (not arrow keys).

## Haptics

Use `triggerHaptic(event)` from `src/react/haptics.ts` at discrete confirm moments only.

| Event | Duration | When |
|---|---|---|
| `"expand"` | 12ms | User confirms expand to full-page |
| `"collapse"` | 10ms | User confirms collapse back |

Rules:
- Global 300ms debounce prevents multiple pulses from blurring together.
- `triggerHaptic` is a no-op when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set.
- Do not trigger haptics on hover, scroll, or intermediate drag positions — only on committed state changes.

---

## Scroll Lock

`acquireScrollLock()` / `releaseScrollLock()` from `src/react/scrollLock.ts` are ref-counted.

- Always pair acquire with release (use `useEffect` cleanup).
- Multiple components (popover, drawer) can lock simultaneously — the ref count handles stacking.
- Sets `overscroll-behavior: none` to prevent mobile pull-to-refresh during popover interactions.
- Compensates for scrollbar width via `padding-right` to prevent layout shift on lock.

---

## Reduced Motion

Always consult `usePrefersReducedMotion()` before applying motion. Rules:

- Pass `0` for duration params rather than skipping the component or returning a Fragment — DOM structure must be identical regardless of motion preference.
- Tailwind `animate-in` / `fade-in-0` classes are applied unconditionally — they degrade gracefully under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` because Tailwind respects the media query.
- Do not add separate reduced-motion code paths for transitions that are already handled by `AnimatedHeightWrapper` or the hooks.
- The one exception: fill-mode stagger animation on `InlineExpandedImage` in expanded-page is skipped entirely (`prefersReducedMotion ? {} : { animationDelay, animationTimingFunction }`).

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **No inline easing values.** Use `EASE_EXPAND` / `EASE_COLLAPSE` from `constants.ts`.
- **No inline duration values.** Use the 5-tier timing constants.
- **No `transition: width`** on content-heavy containers. Snap to target width instead.
- **No `avoidCollisions={true}`** on `<PopoverContent>`. It is unconditionally `false`.
- **No conditional mount/unmount in EvidenceZone.** Always-render with `display: none`.
- **No haptics on hover or scroll.** Only on committed user actions.
- **No `document.body.setAttribute("inert", "")`** for focus trapping. It makes the Radix portal inert. Target `<main>` or individual body children instead.
- **No `animation-duration: 0s` as a reduced-motion workaround.** Pass `0` to the hook params instead — `transitionend` does not fire at 0ms, leaving stale inline styles.
